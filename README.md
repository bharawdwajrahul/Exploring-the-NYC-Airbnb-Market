Airbnb Market Analysis of NYC using python

**Introduction:**

Welcome to my project, "Analyzing the New York City Airbnb Market." In this solo endeavor, I'll take you on a journey into the world of Airbnb listings in one of the most iconic cities globally, New York City. With millions of travelers flocking to the Big Apple every year, there's an immense demand for temporary lodging, spanning from short-term stays to extended getaways. In this project, I aim to gain insights into the New York City Airbnb market by consolidating and analyzing data from various file formats, including CSV, TSV, and Excel.

**Project Overview:**

In this project, I'll explore and analyze three different datasets containing valuable information about 2019 Airbnb listings in New York City. These datasets include:

1. **airbnb_price.csv:** This CSV file provides details about each listing, including a unique identifier (listing_id), the nightly listing price in USD (price), and the name of the borough and neighborhood where the listing is located (nbhood_full).

2. **airbnb_room_type.xlsx:** This Excel file contains information on Airbnb listing descriptions (description), room types (room_type), and their unique identifiers (listing_id).

3. **airbnb_last_review.tsv:** This TSV file contains data on Airbnb host names (host_name) and the dates when the listings were last reviewed (last_review), along with their unique identifiers (listing_id).

**Project Goals:**

Throughout this project, I aim to achieve the following key objectives:

1. **Calculate the Average Nightly Listing Price:** Determining the average price per night for Airbnb listings in New York City, providing an overview of the cost of accommodations in this bustling metropolis.

2. **Compare Airbnb Prices to the Private Rental Market:** Investigating how the average price of an Airbnb listing per month compares to the traditional private rental market, shedding light on the affordability and competitiveness of Airbnb.

3. **Identify the Number of Private Rooms:** Quantifying the number of Airbnb listings offering private rooms, a popular choice among travelers seeking privacy and comfort.

4. **Analyze Airbnb Listing Prices by Borough:** Dissecting Airbnb listing prices to understand how they vary across the five boroughs of New York City, providing valuable insights into regional pricing trends.

**Conclusion:**

The "Analyzing the New York City Airbnb Market" project represents my individual effort to provide a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb listings in the vibrant city of New York. By merging data from multiple file formats, I answer critical questions about pricing, room types, and regional variations, offering valuable insights for both travelers and prospective hosts in the city that never sleeps. This project exemplifies the power of data analysis in uncovering hidden patterns and trends in the world of hospitality, ultimately enriching our understanding of the New York City Airbnb market.
